# Event-Driven Logistics Tracking Platform

Designed a real-time logistics event processing system (#SupplyChainTechnology, #EventDrivenArchitecture) to track shipments, warehouse movements, and customer notifications. Built using Kafka, Python, and DynamoDB to ensure high-throughput, low-latency operations across multiple geographies.

Delivered a merchant-facing dashboard to provide real-time shipment visibility, enhancing platform reliability and operational transparency.

## Architecture Overview

- **Event Source**: Producers emit shipment and warehouse events into Kafka topics.
- **Kafka Broker**: Manages event streaming and distribution.
- **Consumer Service**: Listens to events, processes data, and writes into DynamoDB.
- **DynamoDB**: Stores shipment and warehouse state information.
- **Notifier Service**: Sends real-time updates to customers.
- **Dashboard**: Flask app allowing merchants to view shipment status.

## How to Run

1. **Set up Kafka and DynamoDB**:
   ```bash
   make run-localstack
   ```

2. **Create the table**:
   ```bash
   make create-table
   ```

3. **Run the platform**:
   ```bash
   make start-consumer
   make start-producer
   make start-dashboard
   ```

4. **Or launch everything together**:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

5. **View dashboard**:
   - Open: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
